 * The library folders as this machine sees them. The database keeps a book under a folder as
 * `root:<id>/<path relative to the folder>` (forward slashes, whatever the OS), and each machine
 * says where folder `<id>` is, so a library on a shared drive, a cloud folder or a network share
 * opens from any path. A book outside every folder keeps its absolute path.
 *
 * The mapping is also what the codec uses: `encode()` picks the deepest folder that contains the
 * file, `decode()` joins the folder's path here with the relative part. A stored path whose folder
 * has no path on this machine decodes to itself, which no file matches (the book reads as missing
 * until the folder is relinked), and encodes back to itself.
