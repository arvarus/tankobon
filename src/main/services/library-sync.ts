 * Walks every folder again: new comics are added (as a folder scan does), then the entries under

 * Safety rules, because a removal loses the user's progress, rating and tags: a folder that can't
 * be read as a directory is skipped entirely (an unplugged drive must not empty the library), and an
 * entry goes only when `stat` says the file is gone (`ENOENT`), not merely absent from the walk,
 * which skips the subfolders it can't read. Entries outside every folder (a file added on its own)
 * are checked one by one afterwards: they go when their file is gone and the directory that held it
 * is still readable, so a vanished drive or folder keeps them. Comics inside the folders whose cover
 * is missing get it extracted (`extractCover`, which says whether it made one; a cloud placeholder is
 * skipped, since reading it would download it). Comics inside the folders that have no
 * `.nfo` sidecar get one written from their library information (unless `writeNfos` is off); no other file on disk is touched.
